<p>Welcome to my ENGL 170 blog! I am a student at Lindenwood University, Spring 2026.</p>

<p>In this course, we are exploring the intersection of writing, artificial intelligence, and intellectual work. Over the course of this semester, I'll be posting three times a week, engaging with my peers' ideas and exploring outside research.</p>

<p>You can find the central course dashboard here:
